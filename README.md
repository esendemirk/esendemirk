# Kaan Esendemir
I’m a Software Engineer and Computer Science Educator working at the intersection of large-scale systems and AI-assisted software engineering. In industry, I design and operate business-critical platforms that support complex, real-world workflows. In academia, I teach computer science with an emphasis on applied problem solving, systems thinking, and how modern tools are changing what it means to be an engineer.

My work focuses on how automation and generative AI reshape debugging, software quality, and engineering governance. I’m especially interested in preserving human judgment and system understanding as AI becomes more deeply embedded in how software is built. Through both engineering practice and research, I aim to help bridge the gap between how systems work in theory and how they behave in production.
