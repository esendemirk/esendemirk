# Kaan Esendemir

Lead Software Engineer and Adjunct Professor in Computer Science.

I run backend systems for a multibillion-dollar shipping and logistics enterprise, powering package pickups and intercept workflows.  
I bring industry thinking into academia to help future engineers learn how to approach and reason through real-world engineering problems.

I am always open to helping or bouncing ideas off.
